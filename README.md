Modelant provides JMI-compliant mechanism to read, process, export models in UML 1.3 and UML 1.4, including also an engine for generation of code (any texts) using Object-Oriented Programming
and templates. 

Modelant provides Maven plugins to automate:
* the creation and comparison of UML 1.3, UML 1.4, MOF 1.4 models
* the generation of code from models
* the reverse engineering of java code, relational databases and XML DTD/XSD
* the fransformatoion of models, e.g. tranformation of of UMl 1.3 models to UML 1.4.

The produced UML 1.3 models are suitable to be imported in:
* Rational Rose 2003 + XMI Plugin
* WhiteStar UML / Star UML
* Enterprise Architect
* other
as they employ MOF 1.3/MOF 1.4 as reading MOF 1.3 is internally converted to MOF1.4 and XMI 1.1 and XMI 1.2.

whereas the converted to UML 1.4 models can be imported in:
* Argo UML
* Enterprise Architect
* other
as they employ MOF 1.4 and XMI 1.1 and XMI 1.2.

Modelant wraps the NetBeans Meta-Data Repository (MDR).
