	This is the XML Schema for the EJB 2.1 deployment descriptor.
	The deployment descriptor must be named "META-INF/ejb-jar.xml" in
	the EJB's jar file.  All EJB deployment descriptors must indicate
	the ejb-jar schema by using the J2EE namespace:

	http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee

	and by indicating the version of the schema by
	using the version element as shown below:

	    <ejb-jar xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee"
	      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	      xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee
		  http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/ejb-jar_2_1.xsd"
	      version="2.1">
	      ...
	    </ejb-jar>

	The instance documents may indicate the published version of
	the schema using the xsi:schemaLocation attribute for the
	J2EE namespace with the following location:

	http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/ejb-jar_2_1.xsd

      The following conventions apply to all J2EE
      deployment descriptor elements unless indicated otherwise.

      - In elements that specify a pathname to a file within the
	same JAR file, relative filenames (i.e., those not
	starting with "/") are considered relative to the root of
	the JAR file's namespace.  Absolute filenames (i.e., those
	starting with "/") also specify names in the root of the
	JAR file's namespace.  In general, relative names are
	preferred.  The exception is .war files where absolute
	names are preferred for consistency with the Servlet API.
